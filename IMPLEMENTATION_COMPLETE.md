**Applicable Law & Section:**
Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Section 420 – Cheating and dishonestly inducing 
delivery of property.

**Text (simplified):**

destroy valuable security shall be punished.

**Practical Note:**
This section applies to fraud, scams, or cheating cases. If you are a victim, 
you may lodge an FIR.
